Name: JaCoCo :: Maven Plugin
Description: The JaCoCo Maven Plugin provides the JaCoCo runtime agent to
  your tests and allows basic report creation.
Group Id: org.jacoco
Artifact Id: jacoco-maven-plugin
Version: 0.6.3.201306030806
Goal Prefix: jacoco

This plugin has 6 goals:

jacoco:check
  Description: Checks that the code coverage metrics are being met.
  Implementation: org.jacoco.maven.CheckMojo
  Language: java
  Bound to phase: verify

  Available parameters:

    dataFile (Default: ${project.build.directory}/jacoco.exec)
      File with execution data.

    excludes
      A list of class files to exclude from instrumentation/analysis/reports.
      May use wildcard characters (* and ?). When not specified nothing will be
      excluded.

    haltOnFailure (Default: true)
      Required: true
      User property: jacoco.haltOnFailure
      Halt the build if any of the checks fail.

    includes
      A list of class files to include in instrumentation/analysis/reports. May
      use wildcard characters (* and ?). When not specified everything will be
      included.

    rules
      Required: true
      Check configuration used to specify rules on element types (BUNDLE,
      PACKAGE, CLASS, SOURCEFILE or METHOD) with a list of limits. Each limit
      applies to a certain counter (INSTRUCTION, LINE, BRANCH, COMPLEXITY,
      METHOD, CLASS) and defines a minimum or maximum for the corresponding
      value (TOTALCOUNT, COVEREDCOUNT, MISSEDCOUNT, COVEREDRATIO, MISSEDRATIO).
      If a limit refers to a ratio the range is from 0.0 to 1.0 where the
      number of decimal places will also determine the precision in error
      messages.
      
      This example requires an overall instruction coverage of 80% and no class
      must be missed:
      
      <rules>
        <rule>
          <element>BUNDLE</element>
          <limits>
            <limit>
              <counter>INSTRUCTION</counter>
              <value>COVEREDRATIO</value>
              <minimum>0.80</minimum>
            </limit>
            <limit>
              <counter>CLASS</counter>
              <value>MISSEDCOUNT</value>
              <maximum>0</maximum>
            </limit>
          </limits>
        </rule>
      </rules>
      
      
      This example requires a line coverage minimum of 50% for every class
      except test classes:
      
      <rules>
        <rule>
          <element>CLASS</element>
          <excludes>
            <exclude>*Test</exclude>
          </excludes>
          <limits>
            <limit>
              <counter>LINE</counter>
              <value>COVEREDRATIO</value>
              <minimum>0.50</minimum>
            </limit>
          </limits>
        </rule>
      </rules>

    skip (Default: false)
      User property: jacoco.skip
      Flag used to suppress execution.

jacoco:help
  Description: Display help information on jacoco-maven-plugin.
    Call
      mvn jacoco:help -Ddetail=true -Dgoal=<goal-name>
    to display parameter details.
  Implementation: org.jacoco.maven.HelpMojo
  Language: java

  Available parameters:

    detail (Default: false)
      User property: detail
      If true, display all settable properties for each goal.

    goal
      User property: goal
      The name of the goal for which to show help. If unspecified, all goals
      will be displayed.

    indentSize (Default: 2)
      User property: indentSize
      The number of spaces per indentation level, should be positive.

    lineLength (Default: 80)
      User property: lineLength
      The maximum length of a display line, should be positive.

jacoco:instrument
  Description: Performs offline instrumentation. Note that after execution of
    test you must restore original classes with help of
    'restore-instrumented-classes' goal.
    Warning: The preferred way for code coverage analysis with JaCoCo is
    on-the-fly instrumentation. Offline instrumentation has several drawbacks
    and should only be used if a specific scenario explicitly requires this
    mode. Please consult documentation about offline instrumentation before
    using this mode.
  Implementation: org.jacoco.maven.InstrumentMojo
  Language: java
  Bound to phase: process-classes

  Available parameters:

    excludes
      A list of class files to exclude from instrumentation/analysis/reports.
      May use wildcard characters (* and ?). When not specified nothing will be
      excluded.

    includes
      A list of class files to include in instrumentation/analysis/reports. May
      use wildcard characters (* and ?). When not specified everything will be
      included.

    skip (Default: false)
      User property: jacoco.skip
      Flag used to suppress execution.

jacoco:prepare-agent
  Description: Prepares a property pointing to the JaCoCo runtime agent that
    can be passed as a VM argument to the application under test. Depending on
    the project packaging type by default a property with the following name is
    set:
    - tycho.testArgLine for packaging type eclipse-test-plugin and
    - argLine otherwise.
    Resulting coverage information is collected during execution and by default
    written to a file when the process terminates.
  Implementation: org.jacoco.maven.AgentMojo
  Language: java
  Bound to phase: initialize

  Available parameters:

    address
      User property: jacoco.address
      IP address or hostname to bind to when the output method is tcpserver or
      connect to when the output method is tcpclient. In tcpserver mode the
      value '*' causes the agent to accept connections on any local address.

    append
      User property: jacoco.append
      If set to true and the execution data file already exists, coverage data
      is appended to the existing file. If set to false, an existing execution
      data file will be replaced.

    classDumpDir
      User property: jacoco.classDumpDir
      If a directory is specified for this parameter the JaCoCo agent dumps all
      class files it processes to the given location. This can be useful for
      debugging purposes or in case of dynamically created classes for example
      when scripting engines are used.

    destFile (Default: ${project.build.directory}/jacoco.exec)
      User property: jacoco.destFile
      Path to the output file for execution data.

    dumpOnExit
      User property: jacoco.dumpOnExit
      If set to true coverage data will be written on VM shutdown.

    exclClassLoaders
      User property: jacoco.exclClassLoaders
      A list of class loader names, that should be excluded from execution
      analysis. The list entries are separated by a colon (:) and may use
      wildcard characters (* and ?). This option might be required in case of
      special frameworks that conflict with JaCoCo code instrumentation, in
      particular class loaders that do not have access to the Java runtime
      classes.

    excludes
      A list of class files to exclude from instrumentation/analysis/reports.
      May use wildcard characters (* and ?). When not specified nothing will be
      excluded.

    includes
      A list of class files to include in instrumentation/analysis/reports. May
      use wildcard characters (* and ?). When not specified everything will be
      included.

    jmx
      User property: jacoco.jmx
      If set to true the agent exposes functionality via JMX.

    output
      User property: jacoco.output
      Output method to use for writing coverage data. Valid options are:
      - file: At VM termination execution data is written to the file specified
        in the destfile.
      - tcpserver: The agent listens for incoming connections on the TCP port
        specified by the address and port. Execution data is written to this
        TCP connection.
      - tcpclient: At startup the agent connects to the TCP port specified by
        the address and port. Execution data is written to this TCP connection.
      - none: Do not produce any output.

    port
      User property: jacoco.port
      Port to bind to when the output method is tcpserver or connect to when
      the output method is tcpclient. In tcpserver mode the port must be
      available, which means that if multiple JaCoCo agents should run on the
      same machine, different ports have to be specified.

    propertyName
      User property: jacoco.propertyName
      Allows to specify property which will contains settings for JaCoCo Agent.
      If not specified, then 'argLine' would be used for 'jar' packaging and
      'tycho.testArgLine' for 'eclipse-test-plugin'.

    sessionId
      User property: jacoco.sessionId
      A session identifier that is written with the execution data. Without
      this parameter a random identifier is created by the agent.

    skip (Default: false)
      User property: jacoco.skip
      Flag used to suppress execution.

jacoco:report
  Description: Creates a code coverage report for a single project in
    multiple formats (HTML, XML, and CSV).
  Implementation: org.jacoco.maven.ReportMojo
  Language: java
  Bound to phase: verify

  Available parameters:

    dataFile (Default: ${project.build.directory}/jacoco.exec)
      File with execution data.

    excludes
      A list of class files to exclude from the report. May use wildcard
      characters (* and ?). When not specified nothing will be excluded.

    includes
      A list of class files to include in the report. May use wildcard
      characters (* and ?). When not specified everything will be included.

    outputDirectory (Default: ${project.reporting.outputDirectory}/jacoco)
      Output directory for the reports. Note that this parameter is only
      relevant if the goal is run from the command line or from the default
      build lifecycle. If the goal is run indirectly as part of a site
      generation, the output directory configured in the Maven Site Plugin is
      used instead.

    outputEncoding (Default: UTF-8)
      User property: project.reporting.outputEncoding
      Encoding of the generated reports.

    skip (Default: false)
      User property: jacoco.skip
      Flag used to suppress execution.

    sourceEncoding (Default: UTF-8)
      User property: project.build.sourceEncoding
      Encoding of the source files.

jacoco:restore-instrumented-classes
  Description: Restores original classes as they were before offline
    instrumentation.
  Implementation: org.jacoco.maven.RestoreMojo
  Language: java
  Bound to phase: prepare-package

  Available parameters:
